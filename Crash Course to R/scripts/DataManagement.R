# Intro to data management ------
# In file explorer, make a new folder to house your project
# Make a new R project for every project of your own
# Add folders for data, figures, scripts
# Make a new blank script in "Scripts" folder
# Close RStudio, check that your new script appears in the Scripts folder in file explorer
# Locate your project in file explorer
getwd()
list.files("data/")


# Comments can be added using pound key, and sections are made by adding dashes to the end of comments
# Projects = self-contained worlds, so you donâ€™t break code moving between computers.
# Keep raw data separate, if cleaned, save it as *_cleaned.csv
